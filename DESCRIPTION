Description: HDclustVS is an R package for new block-wise variable selection methods for clustering, HMM-VB-VS and GMM-VB-VS, which exploit the latent states of the hidden Markov model on variable blocks or Gaussian mixture model. The variable blocks are formed by early-stop-and-sorted-depth-first-search (ESS-DFS) on a dendrogram created based on the mutual information between any pair of variables. Then, the variable selection is conducted by an independence test between the latent states and semi-clusters which are the smaller clusters that will be further grouped into final clusters. This package will be merged with HDclust in CRAN in the near future.
